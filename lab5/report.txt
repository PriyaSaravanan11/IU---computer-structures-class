Questions: 

1) the CS pin is chosen by the master and is communicated with by 
lowering the appropriate SS line and then a single word is transferred 
serially over the signal MOSI and at the same time
accepts a single byte from the slave over MOSI as well

2) so that no communication happens 
GYRO_CS_HIGH or GYRO_CS_LOW (are set to high and low)

3) The way the board is wired helps with hooking up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus.
The master will then use the appropriate CS line for communication. 

4) Baud: 8
	Clock: 3MHz
5) To make sure that the transfer of bytes occur smoothly and to be in sync

Difficulties: 

Understanding how to develop the application part was difficult and some of the
instructions in the beginning were hard to follow. Initializations are somewhat clearer now and using the debugger
was a little confusing initially.
